All the current [portfolio](http://alanplotko.com/latest-works) entries from my old site has been transferred and put in successfully. I'll be revamping this site over time as I add updates to the portfolio entries. I'm looking forward to seeing new projects and working with current ones.

Since this will act as a record of recent developments, I've decided to name the blog portion as "The Log" - now if only I could jump onto the terminal and actually consolidate all my memories of what I've worked on by getting the log files.

Update: The site theme has been updated, my resume is up, and a contact form has been added!
