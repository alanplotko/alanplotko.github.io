*In high school, I was a Software Engineering major (our school had a major system) and took a Web Development class as part of major requirements. The course consisted of classwork, homework assignments, projects, and exams. Some of our projects were labeled as levels, which meant that we were to first complete the current project before proceeding to the next project. We could not submit the next project without having first submitted the current project. Each assignment had a deadline to be met as well.*

Lists... lists everywhere! The character catalog was my submission for the catalog project. We just had to select a topic in which we would list and describe things. In my case, I did a catalog on some of the characters in [Ao no Exorcist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Exorcist) (in English: Blue Exorcist), a Japanese manga (comic, although there's debate on manga and comics being different) written and illustrated by Kazue Katō. Blue Exorcist was trending at the time of the project among avid manga readers, especially as it had become an anime (Japanese animation).

This was a fun project in getting the chance to pick out the best character profile pictures for the backgrounds. However, if I were to redo this project without restrictions, it would be more fitting to write a mobile app that catalogs all manga characters. To remain as just a couple of web pages linked together, the CSS (Cascading Style Sheets, the *pretty design* to any web page) would have to be tweaked to intercept and adjust to the dimensions of the visitor's screen. Background images would need to be sized accordingly or removed entirely to substitute for a generic template with a designated area for an image of the character.
