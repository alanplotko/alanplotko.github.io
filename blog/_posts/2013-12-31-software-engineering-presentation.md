This presentation was a last-minute (technically last-hour) creation for my high school's major presentation days. I helped out at the event before as a junior when things were already going well before I could sufficiently contribute. But, this time, I would have to come up with something because I was expecting one of the three to occur: the projector would not be delivered, the projector would start malfunctioning, or we would end up not being in the larger room where a projector could be used. The first one was the case. It's to be expected because the event would become more hectic in my senior year of high school, with the addition of majors and tweaking in the curriculum. Because we could no longer do the usual presentation without the projector, this presentation on a number of computers in the larger room sufficed for the younger students (underclassmen, particularly sophomores, who would be ranking allÂ options in what they can major in later in the spring semester). This presentation was also utilized for the open house in our classroom's lab.
