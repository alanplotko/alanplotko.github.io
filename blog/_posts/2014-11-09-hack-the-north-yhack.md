September and October was quite the run, and here we are in November! It's been a while since my last update - I've been busy with university and hackathons.

After PennApps, I went to Hack the North up in Canada. I'd like to give a shout out to the University of Waterloo for throwing a great hackathon! It was well organized in terms of keeping in check that everyone could get their hands on a meal and find tons of space to work in. I also loved the separation of sleeping and programming quarters. WiFi was even shut down in the sleeping quarters to force the building into a sleeping-only zone. Unfortunately, there were some issues in food delivery, which resulted in heavy lines.

I worked with other Binghamton students on a variety of API's. Our primary goal was to use [wit.ai](https://wit.ai/), an awesome platform for natural language processing. You can form your own "intents" of which wit.ai will process and understand. Using the Bloomberg API, we could turn inquiries about stocks and the financial market into answers. For instance, we could take the question *"How's the stock price over at Company X?"* and decipher that our "intent" is to check stock prices and our parameter or argument is Company X. We came across some obstacles though with utilizing the Bloomberg VPN authorization setup and decided to spend the rest of our time trying out other API's. We ended up choosing Stack Overflow and experimenting with the Stack Exchange API.

YHack was also a fun hackathon - kudos to whoever thought of playing Harry Potter music when we entered the area where we would demo our projects (it was like being sorted into houses). I did not take a liking to the narrow hallways - that made it harder to talk with sponsors. The booths took up half the hallways and the traffic took the rest. Food was not split up into multiple tables for multiple lines, and with a small areas designated for food, the lines would become extremely long. Besides that, I thought YHack did a great job. The organizers were very friendly and very quick to act on pending issues throughout the hackathon.

At YHack, I worked on the Intel Galileo in creating a "smart device" for the home that we called the [Y-2-Kepler](https://github.com/alanplotko/Intel-Galileo-YHack). I took advantage of the starter kit's sensors to keep track of the surrounding environment. For example, it keeps track of abnormal temperatures and allows the end user to generate a selection of notes to play back when they return home. It also tracks the light intensity in the room and contains other inputs for interaction with the Galileo.

Overall, the two hackathons were a blast and I'm preparing for my last hackathon of the semester this weekend: HackRPI. It's also November, which means it's time to get writing the second edition for [National Novel Writing Month](http://alanplotko.com/updates/self-publishing).
