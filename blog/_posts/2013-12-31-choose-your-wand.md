*In high school, I was a Software Engineering major (our school had a major system) and took a Web Development class as part of major requirements. The course consisted of classwork, homework assignments, projects, and exams. Some of our projects were labeled as levels, which meant that we were to first complete the current project before proceeding to the next project. We could not submit the next project without having first submitted the current project. Each assignment had a deadline to be met as well.*

For this assignment, we were to play with the utmost basics of JavaScript (i.e. variables, assignments, arrays) to create a "selection screen" that would usually serve as the interim for a player of a game and the actual game. In this case, I created a screen where the end user could distribute stat points to his or her "wand" and then begin the game (disclaimer: since this is the "selection screen," clicking on the owl will not take you anywhere). The background image is credited to [Pottermore](http://www.pottermore.com/) (since we're talking wands, the first thing that comes to mind is Harry Potter).

Pottermore is pretty neat in its attempt to make Harry Potter an interactive story and somewhat of a game. I was one of the many first users to try out Pottermore and the experience was great. A nice revision to this assignment is to add in PHP as to actually allow interaction with a database to register user accounts and create my own "Pottermore," but only for [my story](http://nanowrimo.org/participants/rdrazard/novels).
