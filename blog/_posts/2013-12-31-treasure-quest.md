*In high school, I was a Software Engineering major (our school had a major system) and took a Web Development class as part of major requirements. The course consisted of classwork, homework assignments, projects, and exams. Some of our projects were labeled as levels, which meant that we were to first complete the current project before proceeding to the next project. We could not submit the next project without having first submitted the current project. Each assignment had a deadline to be met as well.*

Treasure Quest was my submission for a project that supplemented our knowledge of links and website hierarchy as well as CSS (Cascading Style Sheets, the *pretty design* to any web page). In this project, we had to write up a story that someone would interact with by clicking on different links. In Treasure Quest, the male protagonist's friend's grandfather hid his riches on an island far away for that friend to recover. Since the grandfather has passed away, it is up to the male protagonist to go on an adventure, while his friend distracts the attending relatives at the reading of the will... -insert [all persons fictitious disclaimer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_persons_fictitious_disclaimer) here-

It is essentially up to the visitor on the web page to make the right choices to complete the adventure successfully. These choices lead down a complex route in determining whether the male protagonist succeeds or fails in his objective. In other words, Treasure Quest is like a [text adventure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_game#Text_adventure) with added graphics - the only catch is that the user is selecting predetermined choices rather than typing them into a console as commands. For an actual text adventure, check out [Level 4](http://alanplotko.com/portfolio/haunted-mansion).
