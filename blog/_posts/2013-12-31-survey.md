*In high school, I was a Software Engineering major (our school had a major system) and took a Web Development class as part of major requirements. The course consisted of classwork, homework assignments, projects, and exams. Some of our projects were labeled as levels, which meant that we were to first complete the current project before proceeding to the next project. We could not submit the next project without having first submitted the current project. Each assignment had a deadline to be met as well.*

Yay for forms! For this assignment, we had to create a survey form for the end user to fill out and then view those choices on the results page. The form doesn't submit anywhere (no PHP), so it's just for show.

The logo, by the way, is from a forum community oriented towards those who read manga or watch anime. It was pretty active back when I founded it in 2008 and peaked 2-3 years later at approximately 100 users. However, with the entire community having crashed many times (bad web hosts) or even shut down (the web hosts, not the site; the site kept coming back), many had left or were lost (they gave up or they couldn't get to the new site). I developed the forum community from that point on to become what it is today with the new logo seen in this assignment. It's become a bit active after its grand reopening, but it will take some time to get a similar participating audience.
