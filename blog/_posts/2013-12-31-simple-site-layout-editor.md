*In high school, I was a Software Engineering major (our school had a major system) and took a Web Development class as part of major requirements. The course consisted of classwork, homework assignments, projects, and exams. Some of our projects were labeled as levels, which meant that we were to first complete the current project before proceeding to the next project. We could not submit the next project without having first submitted the current project. Each assignment had a deadline to be met as well.*

After [Level 4](http://alanplotko.com/portfolio/haunted-mansion), Level 5 seemed to be a cool-down period for everyone. We were to build a simple site layout editor that utilized JavaScript to modify the layout and then save the custom modifications with a custom name to be accessed later on. With JavaScript, it's only a matter of creating an object with the properties we want and then dynamically storing and accessing these objects. With Level 5 out of the way, we only had the [final project](http://alanplotko.com/portfolio/portfolier) left, which was a joint project between two of my classes: *Web Development* and *Oracle Academy Database Development Level I*.
