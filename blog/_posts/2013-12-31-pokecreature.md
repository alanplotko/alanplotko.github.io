PokeCreature was a joint idea between myself and two friends in making a game similar to the [Pokemon Mystery Dungeon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Mystery_Dungeon) series after discussing [A* (pathfinding)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm)Â in our Computer Science A (Java) course. Just as a character would find the shortest path between point A (current location) and point B (end user's chosen location) to travel, we could utilize the same concept and make a spin-off the original Pokemon games ourselves. PokeCreature was the website for that idea - just an experiment of using jQuery to create fancy animations and transitions as seen in video game presentation sites (although PokeCreature is much less complex in comparison). Coming up with the design was the most difficult aspect, although it came out quite nicely.
