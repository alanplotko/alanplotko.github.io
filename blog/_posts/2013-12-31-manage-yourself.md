Manage Yourself (MYS) is a project started by a college student for college students. The interface will be shaped to benefit the average college student. The user will be able to register an account on MYS and specify the college he or she is attending. The user can then choose to disclose their current year (i.e. undergraduate or graduate and year within the program). This information will only act aesthetically to show the user their progress in their program.

The default ability each registered user obtains is to create schedules per semester and integrate their schedule with the MYS planner. Default options for events that users can add to their MYS planner will include: assignment deadlines, exam dates, class registration periods, add/drop periods, and billing periods (i.e. when the user is expected to make payments to their college or university). Custom events and their respective categories may be created by the user.

MYS aims to act as a very free organizational tool for its users. With the extent of what users can create, MYS will require great funding to keep up in database space when storing events. Preferably, MYS will perhaps become a local tool whose storage will remain local and in sync with the online user account. By having access to the desktop, MYS can avoid storage issues in the future, while having access to go beyond what an online planner can do (e.g. desktop alerts for when events or deadlines are coming up). Another solution to storage issues is working with third party services (e.g. Dropbox) to store information. The worst case scenario for MYS would be to implement a paid plan system that charges the user to break even with costs that MYS may incur.
