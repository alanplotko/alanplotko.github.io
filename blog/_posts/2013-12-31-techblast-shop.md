*In high school, I was a Software Engineering major (our school had a major system) and took a Web Development class as part of major requirements. The course consisted of classwork, homework assignments, projects, and exams. Some of our projects were labeled as levels, which meant that we were to first complete the current project before proceeding to the next project. We could not submit the next project without having first submitted the current project. Each assignment had a deadline to be met as well.*

**Level 3** makes [level 1](http://alanplotko.com/portfolio/all-hallows-eve-shop) look bad. Our third level was to actually create a functioning shop that printed a receipt to the screen. In a real world application, cookies, PHP, and MySQL could handle the user side of things (i.e. accounts, recording transactions, and saving guests' carts), but for this level, it wasn't so complex. I had fun building the user interface, since it was the same tab system as the [survey](http://alanplotko.com/portfolio/survey). I was considering making a shop for the forum community that I started, so this was good practice. As an Easter egg, the logo flashes red when you click it.
