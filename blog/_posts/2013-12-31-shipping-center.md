*In high school, I was a Software Engineering major (our school had a major system) and took a Web Development class as part of major requirements. The course consisted of classwork, homework assignments, projects, and exams. Some of our projects were labeled as levels, which meant that we were to first complete the current project before proceeding to the next project. We could not submit the next project without having first submitted the current project. Each assignment had a deadline to be met as well.*

This assignment tested for using JavaScript to move child elements to different parent elements. The setting was that of a shipping center where child elements were the products and parent elements were the crates. Small crates held 2 items at max, medium crates held 4, and large crates held 6 - after that, a carrier would ship them to their owners. I happened to find some nice icons of phones, desktops, and printers, and decided to make my product theme "technology" in general. My favorite part about this assignment was looking into jQuery to animate a truck across the end user's screen, once a crate reaches its capacity.
