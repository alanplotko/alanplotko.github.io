Last weekend, I attended [PennApps X](http://pennapps.com/). There were two things I noticed at PennApps that I did not see as clearly at my previous hackathons:

1. Varying experience levels.
2. High schoolers.

In other words, PennApps has done a wonderful job. Having inexperienced students attend is vital for not only growing the "hacker community", but also for allowing these students to develop their skills. Many students use hackathons as a means for picking up something new - for attendees with experience, this turns out to become a routine in which many polish their skills and become more adept at building products in short time periods. However, I've noticed that many hackathons that feel competitive have rejected newer students to ensure that spots went to "hackers" who could make an impact. This approach just develops the stronger members of the "hacker community" and leaves a gap between them and the younger students. We need to encourage students to join the community and embrace "hacker culture", and not turn them away. While it's not feasible to accept many new students, there should be a balance - a golden ratio, if you will - for what allows a hackathon to succeed, maintain a certain level of competition, and still provide new students the chance to join the community.

**Disclaimer:** *I'm not saying PennApps necessarily achieved that ratio and I'm not saying there wasn't such a balance at my previous hackathons.* Everything is based off one's perspective. I could have been in the wrong room at the wrong time and my opinion could have been skewed as a result. I equally loved all the hackathons I went to so far as each one had something that made it special and unique. The room I was in for PennApps had many people that were learning new technologies for the first time. BitCamp definitely had a large amount of newer students and HackPrinceton seemed somewhat balanced, but PennApps simply stood out greatly, especially with lots of high schoolers attending and being close enough in a small area to watch their progress over the weekend. I believe inviting high school students was the one factor that BitCamp and HackPrinceton did not have, due to issues in allowing underage students. As far as I'm concerned, the earlier students can get exposed to programming, the better. Having high schoolers join college students for a weekend filled with swag, code, and fun will only accelerate the growth of hackathons - take MLH, for example. [Major League Hacking](http://mlh.io/) is the hackathon enthusiast's guide to hackathons happening each semester, and now [Minor League Hacking](http://minorleaguehacking.com/) has risen, with a focus for high school students wanting to join in on the fun. There were tons of cool prizes at PennApps and hardware ranged from the [Myo](https://www.thalmic.com/en/myo/) to the [Oculus Rift](http://www.oculusvr.com/). And drones. Don't forget the drones.

I guess what I'm really saying is that PennApps seemed to have really outdone themselves with bringing in so many students, many of them being high schoolers. While BitCamp is my favorite hackathon so far with their organization of events and staff, PennApps rises to the top of my list for having extended attendance to high school students. Hack the North is coming up next weekend - I look forward to seeing how they do.

Aside from that, I worked with a fellow student on Campus QuickStart (CQS), a Python web application using the Bottle Framework, MongoDB, and SendGrid. CQS enables students with new ideas for a club or organization to build that group's online brand and presence. No website development experience is necessary to get their idea off the ground - they simply provide information about the club or organization and the web application will plug that data into various templates and offer hosting or a download of the files for hosting elsewhere. In a few minutes, the student can get a website for their club or organization, allowing them to focus on other matters such as paperwork and recruiting members. CQS is hosted with Heroku's cloud platform as a service. MongoDB stores the data we receive from students who use the service to host their club's or organization's website online with us and SendGrid facilitates our email communications regarding account matters between us (the developers) and the students (club or organization leaders). SendGrid also powers our contact forms for email communications between the students (club or organization leaders) and the prospective members and staff, who may be visitors to their website. Students provide some information about their club or organization, select a theme, and have their website generated and hosted at the click of a button. There are also options for the long term that will allow for exporting the website files for hosting elsewhere and hosting via GitHub Pages.
