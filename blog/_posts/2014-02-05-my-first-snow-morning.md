title: My First "Snow Morning"

As a college student studying computer science at Binghamton University, I couldn't believe my eyes when the campus alert system notified me at 5:00 a.m. that there would be no morning classes due to excessive snow. A foot of snow was expected since last night, but it really didn't seem that storm would be coming until the following morning when I saw the piles of snow from failed attempts to clear the paths. However, classes would resume in the afternoon when the paths could be used, so it's not quite a snow day -- rather, it's a *snow morning*. Nonetheless, it's my first *snow morning* here at Binghamton. With no morning classes to keep me busy, I decided to continue working on a [personal project](http://alanplotko.com/portfolio/japanese-animation-comics-tracker) that would benefit the Japanese animation (anime) and comics (manga) community. You can check out the progress on GitHub [here](https://github.com/alanplotko/tracker). You can see the snow below.
