*In high school, I was a Software Engineering major (our school had a major system) and took a Web Development class as part of major requirements. The course consisted of classwork, homework assignments, projects, and exams. Some of our projects were labeled as levels, which meant that we were to first complete the current project before proceeding to the next project. We could not submit the next project without having first submitted the current project. Each assignment had a deadline to be met as well.*

All Hallow's Eve Shop was Level 1. We were to simply reflect our knowledge of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language, the *bare bones* structure to any web page) by creating a few pages and linking them together. The time was around October, so Halloween was coming up. I caught a glimpse of some nice icons and graphic design being done and put up in the public domain at the time, so I decided to put it all together to create a simple, static shop with no functions whatsoever. HTML image maps were the last lesson, so I decided to integrate into the project as well. Since HTML was the first language to be covered, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets, the *pretty design* in any web page) and JavaScript (which allows user interaction) were out of scope.

Considering this was my first level, anything out of scope was not forbidden; I was permitted to experiment. You can check out the shop, but don't expect much as the only thing being asked for, after all, was just the materials covered in class on HTML.
