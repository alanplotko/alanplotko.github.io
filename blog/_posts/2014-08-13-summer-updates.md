And before you know it, almost three months have passed by. I've been busy recently with an internship in Maryland and it's almost time for classes to start up again back in New York. Here are some highlights of my summer so far, though:

- I dropped by Washington D.C. during my free time on the weekends and managed to cover a moonlight night tour and two Smithsonian museums (Air and Space &amp; Natural History). I also viewed the Changing of the Guard ceremony at the Arlington National Cemetery and took a quick detour to see the U.S. Capitol Building.

- [NaNoWriMo](http://alanplotko.com/the-log/self-publishing) gave me the chance to write my story with no distractions. Lulu for self publishing turned my draft into a beautiful hardcover novel and CreateSpace offered two quality paperback copies. I tidied up the draft slightly and received the shipment earlier this summer.

- Amazon Prime. Lots of Amazon Prime. If you're a student with a .edu email address, do us both a favor and [sign up for a free 6-month trial](http://www.amazon.com/gp/student/signup/info?ie=UTF8&amp;refcust=74GNRLSJPC765UE7ASYA6Q3YDA&amp;ref_type=generic) to get free 2-day shipping and other benefits that follow if you decide to keep prime later on.

- I finally moved AlanPlotko.com to a new host; downtime was minimal during the transfer process.
- I got back to updating some old projects on GitHub, although some of them can't be seen because they're private repositories.
- I've been working on my old forum community (built on [myBB](http://mybb.com/)). I have a VPS with tons of bandwidth, courtesy of [HapHost](http://haphost.com/), that I'm interested in using to run [Legend of the Green Dragon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legend_of_the_Red_Dragon#Legend_of_the_Green_Dragon), an open-source role-playing game built in PHP that allows for customization. I'm in the process of revamping the forum design.
