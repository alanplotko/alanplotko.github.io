Dash is the name of the robot mascot character as well as this project, which aims to bring all relevant data in your life to one central screen. Dash is written in Python 3.3 and utilizes the Bottle framework.

With Dash, you can hook in your own custom Python modules that will grab data (via API's, saved files, etc.) and show them on the screen. Each module you write will create its own widget for the dashboard. Dash runs a server locally, which you can customize to run on startup as well as set up to be the home page for your browser of choice.

In the screenshot below, I'm using the [Anime Tracker](http://alanplotko.com/portfolio/japanese-animation-comics-tracker) that I've ported to work with Dash and a sample module (CheckMyLaundry) in the works. CheckMyLaundry will parse data from Binghamton University's eSuds page, which contains information on what washers and dryers are available and the estimated times for availability for each residential community and its buildings.
