*In high school, I was a Software Engineering major (our school had a major system) and took a Web Development class as part of major requirements. The course consisted of classwork, homework assignments, projects, and exams. Some of our projects were labeled as levels, which meant that we were to first complete the current project before proceeding to the next project. We could not submit the next project without having first submitted the current project. Each assignment had a deadline to be met as well.*

A fully functional site was the final joint project for *Web Development* and *Oracle Academy Database Development Level I*. Students submitted complete forum systems, shopping systems, and services similar to PayPal. I completed Portfolier with a classmate together, which could be seen as similar to [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/), but focusing solely on showing a registered member's portfolio to the end user. The targeted audience was students and prospective employees who would utilize Portfolier to host their portfolios and send them to employers. After Level 4, this was a huge step up to creating something that could potentially go out into the real world. While Portfolier won't be making an appearance as a startup for now, you can check it out on my classmate's site [here](http://edax.me/sites/portfolier/). Portfolier utilized PHP and MySQL for storing the member's information, while the frontend was just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
